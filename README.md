# Text summarization 

## Motivation of Project
* A lot of real world applications on daily produce text data like articles, 
  news, sport commentary, movie subtitles, scientific research etc. Summarization 
  involves extracting the key summary from the big text document.
* Task of generating intelligent and accurate summaries for long  text is very
  popular area of research in Natural Language Processing

## Text summarization methods
* Mainly there are two methods for text summarization as given below
    + Extractive Text summarization 
        + In this method the sentences in the text document are given some
          weight depending upon how much importance they hold in the document.
          The resulting summary consists of all the inorder sentences which have 
          got the highest weight.
    + Abstractive Text summarization
        + In this method new shorter sentences are generated by interpreting the 
          semantics of the context. It can be correlated to the way human reads 
          a text article or blog post and then summarizes in their own word.

## Implementation of Extractive text summarization Algorithms

* The project is based on doing extractive text summarization on text document
  using the algorithm named **TextRank**. It is unsupervised learning algorithm
  which ranks the sentences based on similarity for summarization.
